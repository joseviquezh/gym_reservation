# gym_reservation

This tools allows to automatically make class reservations through the reservations app. The classes can be in different areas, as specified in the JSON file. Both area and time *MUST* be specified exactly as they appear in the app, meaning that the time selected must be available for the class in the desired area, otherwise the reservation won't be made
