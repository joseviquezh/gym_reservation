# gym_reservation

This tool allows you to automatically make class reservations through the reservations app. The classes can be in different areas, as specified in the JSON file. Both area and time *MUST* be specified exactly as they appear in the app, meaning that the time selected must be available for the class in the desired area, otherwise the reservation won't be made
